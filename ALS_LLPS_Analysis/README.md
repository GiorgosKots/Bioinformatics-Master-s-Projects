# ALS-LLPS Protein Analysis

This project investigates statistical and sequence-based differences between ALS-associated proteins and non-ALS proteins that undergo Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). The focus is on analyzing Low Complexity Regions (LCRs) and Compositionally Biased Regions (CBRs) using bioinformatics tools and statistical tests.

## üî¨ Objectives
- Understand the role of LCRs and CBRs in ALS-related LLPS proteins.
- Compare ALS-LLPS proteins to non-ALS LLPS proteins using statistical methods.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- BioPython
- PlatoLoCo
- SEG (Low Complexity Regions)
- CAST (Compositionally Biased Regions)
- SciPy / NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## üìä Key Results
- ALS-LLPS proteins show significantly higher LCR and CBR sequence coverage.
- ALS-related sequences are enriched in glycine and proline.
- Higher overlap exists between low-complexity and biased regions in ALS-LLPS proteins.
