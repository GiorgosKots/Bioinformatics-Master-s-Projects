# Bioinformatics Master's Projects

Welcome to my Bioinformatics Master's Projects repository! This repository is a collection of projects completed during my master's program in Bioinformatics. Each project explores different aspects of bioinformatics, from algorithm development to data analysis and visualization.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Suffix Trie Construction
- **Description**: This project focuses on creating a suffix trie from the suffix array of a given DNA sequence. It explores how sequence complexity affects the size and structure of the suffix trie.
- **Key Concepts**: Suffix tries, suffix arrays, sequence complexity.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Graphviz.
